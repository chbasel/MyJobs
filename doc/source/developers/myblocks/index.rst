MyBlocks
===============
MyBlocks is a designed as a platform for creating highly customizable, modular components called Blocks. Blocks can be
used independently on a page, or together to form an entire webpage.

Overview
===============

MyBlocks was originally conceived as an idea to extend the customization of Microsites webpages while offering a method
for ease of reuse of components. With MyBlocks, each block represents a bootstrap div with spans and offsets to allow
sizing of each module. Nesting of blocks can also occur, for instance: a body block may job listing block, which contains
individual job blocks. These blocks then combine with others create a entire dynamic webpage.

The idea that a Blocks page was the only place where a Block might occur was modified when Secure Blocks was conceptualized.
Secure Blocks are components that are loaded onto a page using special div tags and secured with a cross site verification
process. These blocks can be found on any Microsite and are currently employed as widgets on a page.
