<h2>Partner Relationship Manager (PRM)</h2>
<p>
    The new OFCCP regulations that went into effect March 24, 2014 for VEVRAA

    and Section 503 require federal contractors to build meaningful

    relationships with diversity, disability, veteran, female and other

    minority organizations. This also means recording communications and

    exchanges with those partners and demonstrating outreach effectiveness.
